# Stage 2: Set up Production Server

# Debian (glibc), NOT alpine. The original reason was onnxruntime-node (pulled in
# by @huggingface/transformers for CLIP inference), which shipped glibc-linked
# prebuilts and failed to dlopen on musl — issue #19. That dependency is gone with
# CLIP, so alpine may now be viable.
# ponytail: not switched, because sqlite3 and sharp prebuilts have their own
# glibc assumptions and proving that out is a separate job from removing CLIP.

# Native build tools for SQLite3, gosu to drop root in the entrypoint, plus
# wget (healthcheck), ca-certificates (HTTPS to the card APIs) and curl —
# the Moxfield sync shells out to a TLS-impersonating curl because Cloudflare
# fingerprints the TLS client (JA3) and challenges non-browser handshakes
# from this host's egress IP: node's handshake and the system curl
# (OpenSSL 3.0.x) get 403 challenge pages, a Chrome-shaped ClientHello gets
# straight through (see backend/src/moxfieldApi.js).

# curl-impersonate v2.1.0 (glibc build): a curl built against BoringSSL that
# presents a Chrome 124 TLS fingerprint — the only handshake Cloudflare in
# front of api2.moxfield.com accepts from a server. Pinned release URL, x86_64
# only (the build host is x86_64; swap the URL suffix for aarch64 if that
# ever changes). backend/src/moxfieldApi.js execs /usr/local/bin/curl-impersonate
# and falls back to plain curl if it is missing.

# Set environment to production
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV PORT=3001
# Card scanning needs a secure context, and a container reached at
# http://<host>:3001 is not one, so TLS is served alongside HTTP. The cert is
# self-signed into /app/database/ssl on first start (persisted with the volume)
# unless SSL_CERT_PATH/SSL_KEY_PATH point at a real one. Set HTTPS_PORT="" to
# serve plain HTTP only.
ENV HTTPS_PORT=3443
# Upgrades from an image that used pokemon_cards.db keep their data: the app
# renames the old file (and its WAL sidecars) into place on first start.
ENV DB_PATH=/app/database/bindarr.db
# Scan models and catalogs live on the persisted volume, both so a build has a
# writable target under the non-root `node` user and so an image update does not
# discard them. The two ONNX models are NOT in the image — they are AGPL-3.0 while
# Bindarr is MIT, so the operator fetches them into this directory deliberately:
#   docker exec <container> node scripts/fetch-models.mjs
ENV CV_MODEL_DIR=/app/database/models

# Create database volume mount target directory. Nothing else: a subdirectory
# created here as root inside a volume the entrypoint has already handed over to
# `node` is one the server can never write into. The server creates its own at
# startup, as its own user.

# ONNXRUNTIME_NODE_INSTALL_CUDA=skip: onnxruntime-node's postinstall otherwise
# fetches the CUDA/DirectML native packages from api.nuget.org, which fails on any
# build host without access to it. Inference here is CPU-only (two small models),
# and the CPU binaries ship inside the npm package itself.
RUN ONNXRUNTIME_NODE_INSTALL_CUDA=skip npm ci --omit=dev
# Recompile ONLY sqlite3 from source: its node-pre-gyp prebuilt is linked
# against a newer glibc (GLIBC_2.38) than this Debian base provides, so the
# prebuilt aborts at startup with ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED. Building here links against
# the image's own glibc. Scoped to sqlite3 so sharp keeps its prebuilt (sharp
# can't build from source without libvips-dev).
RUN npm rebuild sqlite3 --build-from-source

# Copy backend source files
COPY backend/src/ ./src/

# Nothing here is on a runtime path — the whole index build lives in src/ — but

# eval-global-index.mjs measures what the index actually identifies, and
# cardSources.js is what it resolves reference images through.
