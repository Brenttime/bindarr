// "Connect" for the marketplace credential panels: a visibility launcher,
// not a credential channel.
//
// Two facts decide the design:
//   - Bindarr cannot inject anything into a manapool.com / tcgplayer.com page.
//     A popup has no cross-origin scripting access, period.
//   - localStorage is partitioned per SITE FOR TOP FRAME. A manapool.com popup
//     opened by Bindarr does NOT share a readable store with the Bindarr tab
//     (opaque/second-site origins), so the old injected-script + poll design
//     could never deliver a credential. It always timed out.
//
// What Connect honestly does now: open, from the click itself (so popup
// blockers are satisfied by real user activation), the page where each
// credential is DISPLAYED to the signed-in user:
//   manapool  -> the profile's Account tab, which shows the API access token
//                (Creator Studio cannot display it; the profile tab can).
//   tcgplayer -> the account page, where dev-tools cookie capture is explained.
// The user copies the value and pastes it into the field beside the button.
// Nothing is captured, transmitted, or polled; there is never a credential in
// Bindarr's memory. The tab is verified open in the same tick as the call --
// nothing may sit behind an await before window.open -- so callers can toast
// success only for real launches and errors only for real failures.
