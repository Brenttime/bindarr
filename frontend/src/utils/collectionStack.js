// single "x2" row wearing whichever row came first -- the foil read as a
// non-foil and even priced off the wrong column (priceHelpers.resolveCardPrice
// picks price_holofoil vs price_normal off the row's printing). A foil is a
// physically different card and is never interchangeable with its non-foil twin,

// before. CollectionList previously did a bare `+=`, so the only place this
