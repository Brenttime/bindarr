// A cosine sweep always returns its nearest row, so "not in the catalog" and
// "here is your card" arrive in exactly the same shape. That is how Japanese
// Pokemon scans came back wrong: TCGdex serves card data for 28 of the 177
// Japanese sets it lists, so most Japanese cards had no row and were answered
// with the nearest of the ~3.3k that did.
//
// Three things stop that, and this checks all three:
//   1. cvScan.GAP_FLOOR — a winner that does not stand clear of ranks 2-11 of its
//      own catalog reports `notInCatalog`, and the client refuses to auto-add on
//      it (scripts/measure-scan-floor.js is where the number comes from, and why
//      the gate is a gap rather than an absolute cosine).
//   2. loadAll — a non-English scan sweeps the English catalog too, because the
//      artwork is identical and English has a row for nearly every card the
//      Japanese catalog is missing.
//   3. Set scoping stays per-catalog: a Japanese set id names no row in the
//      English catalog, so that catalog is dropped from a scoped sweep rather
//      than searched unscoped.
//
// Needs the ONNX models, a Japanese Pokemon catalog and network for one card
// image; skips rather than fails without them.
//
