// Per-deck ownership for the deck list: how many of each deck's cards the
// user owns, and what is still missing. Same rules as the deck editor's
// "N cards still missing" (frontend utils/deckText.js missingEntries):
//   - cards are keyed by canonical name, so every printing counts toward it
//   - owned copies are the user's whole collection, summed across printings
//   - basic lands are exempt (always treated as owned)
//   - missing_card_types counts NAMES short (the header's number);
//     missing_copies counts the copies short (for "owned X / Y")
// One grouped query for every deck of the user; no per-deck round trips.
