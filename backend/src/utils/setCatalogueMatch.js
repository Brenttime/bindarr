// Join one provider's set list to another's.
//
// The scan-index panel lists the sets it can BUILD (setIndex.listAllSets) and
// decorates each with display metadata — name, release date, card count, logo —
// from the local `sets` table. For Pokémon that table is populated from
// pokemontcg.io (tcgApi.fetchAndCacheSets), but the buildable list comes from
// TCGdex whenever that provider is selected, and the two do not agree on ids:
//
//   TCGdex      pokemontcg.io
//   sv01        sv1              Scarlet & Violet
//   sv03.5      sv3pt5           151
//   swsh9.5tg   swsh9tg          Brilliant Stars Trainer Gallery
//   cel25cc     cel25c           Celebrations Classic Collection
//
// A bare normalized-id join therefore missed 91 of TCGdex's 218 English sets —
// every Scarlet & Violet release among them — and those rows rendered as a raw
// set code with no year and no card count, which reads as a broken catalogue
// rather than as two providers numbering their sets differently.
//
// Three keys, tried in order of how much they can be trusted:
//
//   1. normalized id   — punctuation and case removed. Exact, always right.
//   2. unpadded id     — leading zeros dropped from a digit run that follows a
//                        letter, so sv01 reaches sv1. Deliberately NOT a general
//                        zero strip: "2011bw" (McDonald's Collection 2011) would
//                        become "211bw" and could then collide with something
//                        unrelated.
//   3. normalized name — the last resort, and the one that recovers the ".5"
//                        sets whose ids diverge past repair (sv3pt5 vs sv035).
//
// Keys that more than one catalogue row claims are dropped rather than guessed
// at: a wrong join here silently shows one set's release date and card count
// under another set's name, which is worse than the blank it replaces.
// Diacritics are folded BEFORE the a-z filter, not stripped by it. Dropping the
// accent as an illegal character turns "Pokémon GO" into "pokmongo" while a
// provider spelling it "Pokemon GO" gives "pokemongo" — two keys for one set, and
// the join silently misses. Decomposing first makes both "pokemongo".
