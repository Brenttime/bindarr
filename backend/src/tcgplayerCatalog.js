// TCGplayer's product catalogue, so the READY-MADE Pokémon scan catalog can name
// what it matches.
//
// The published catalog (milo-pokemon.npz) stores TCGplayer product ids and
// nothing else — verified: its `card_ids` are strings like "42346" and its
// `source` is "tcgplayer". Turning one into a card used to go product id ->
// tcgplayer_product -> card_cache, and both of those tables are filled by work an
// install may never have done: card_cache by a set walk, tcgplayer_product as a
// side effect of the Pokémon price sweep over already-cached sets. On a fresh
// install both are empty, so every scan matched a product id it could not name and
// the user was told "no confident match".
//
// This walks TCGCSV's whole Pokémon catalogue once and records product id ->
// (set, number, name). A scan can then hand the client a set and a number, which
// resolves through the ordinary search path — including fetching and caching the
// card from the provider, exactly like a manual search would.
//
// One request per group, ~400 groups across the two Pokémon categories, and the
// result is a few tens of thousands of rows. Re-runnable: rows are replaced, never
// deleted, so a rebuild after a new set release is additive.
