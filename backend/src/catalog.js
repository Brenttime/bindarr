// Catalog builds: the one job that makes scanning work.
//
// A catalog is one language. Building it has two phases, and the first is the
// one that was missing for years:
//
//   1. CACHE — walk every set Scryfall lists and pull its cards into
//      card_cache. This used to happen only as a side effect of building an ORB
//      scan index, so a set nobody indexed, searched or browsed simply was not
//      there.
//   2. EMBED — run every cached card's artwork through milo and write the
//      embedding table the scanner searches.
//
// Phase 2 can only ever be as complete as phase 1, which is why they are one job
// rather than two buttons. Both resume: phase 1 is idempotent, and phase 2 keeps
// every embedding whose image_url has not changed.
