// Why a separate provider at all: every card API Bindarr already talks to quotes
// the RAW card. A PSA 10 of the same printing routinely sells for ten to fifty
// times that, so valuing a slab at the raw price is not an approximation, it is a
// different card's price.
//
// The number this returns is eBay completed sales for that card AT THAT GRADE —
// `ebay.salesByGrade.psa10` and friends, which cover PSA, BGS and CGC including
// half grades, per card, wherever sales exist.
//
// Credits are the design constraint. The free tier is 100 a day and the provider
// bills PER CARD RETURNED (2 with `includeEbay`), so a 50-card default page would
// spend a day's allowance on one button press. Hence: look the card up by its
// TCGplayer product id when we know it — one card, exact, 2 credits — and fall
// back to a name search capped at a handful. There is no sweep and no background
// refresh, and there must not be one.
